    <p>Trypophobia is a proposed phobia of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps. 
      The condition is not officially recognized as a mental disorder, and is rarely referenced in 
      scientific literature. Many people today claim to have this unusual fear. It is more of a discomfort
    and gross feeling when holes are seen</p>
